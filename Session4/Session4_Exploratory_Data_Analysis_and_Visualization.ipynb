    "Learn to summarize and visualize datasets to uncover patterns and distributions. We will compute key statistics and create plots (histograms, boxplots, bar/pie charts, scatterplots, heatmaps) to identify trends, outliers, and relationships in real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often with visualization. For example, as an analyst working with Tanzanian financial data, you might first compute averages and medians of incomes to understand “typical” values, and then plot histograms or boxplots to see how income is distributed. This helps identify patterns, spot anomalies or outliers, and reveal relationships among variables. Throughout this session, we focus on practical data science applications in Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)."

The **mean** (average) sums all values and divides by count. The **median** is the middle value that splits the sorted data in half (it is not influenced by extreme values). The **mode** is the most frequent value. **Variance** and **standard deviation** quantify spread: standard deviation measures the typical distance of data points from the mean.
