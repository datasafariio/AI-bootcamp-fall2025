    "This session is designed to equip learners with fundamental Python programming constructs that are indispensable for data manipulation, analysis, and automation. The session will delve into how Python programs make decisions using conditional statements, efficiently perform repetitive tasks through loops, and organize code for reusability with functions. Additionally, the session will introduce the crucial concept of handling unexpected issues gracefully using basic exception handling. By the conclusion of this session, learners will possess the ability to write Python code that intelligently responds to data conditions, processes substantial datasets, and creates modular, maintainable solutions.\n",

    " The `for` loop in Python iterates directly over the items of any sequence or other iterable object, executing a designated block of code for each item. This makes it particularly well-suited for situations where the number of iterations is known in advance, such as processing every element within a list or characters within a string or dataset. The basic syntax is `for variable in iterable: # block of code`.\n",

    "This direct iteration over items, often referred to as the \"Pythonic way\", represents a fundamental design philosophy that promotes cleaner, more readable, and less error-prone code for data processing. Instead of manually managing indices, programmers can focus directly on the data elements themselves. This approach is especially advantageous in data science, where the primary concern is frequently the values contained within a collection rather than their precise positional indices. This leads to more expressive and maintainable data manipulation scripts. While functions like `enumerate()` can provide indices when necessary, the default emphasis remains on item-based processing.\n",

    "  The `range()` function is frequently used in conjunction with `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers. This is useful for iterating a specific number of times or for generating indices to access elements in a sequence. The function can be used in several ways: `range(stop)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `stop`; `range(start, stop)` generates numbers from `start` up to (but not including) `stop`; and `range(start, stop, step)` generates numbers from `start` up to `stop`, incrementing by `step`.\n",
